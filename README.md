Welcome to Mathematically
=========================

Mathematically is just a collection of mathematical algorithms I've implemented as I work through the exercises on [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org).

This library is not meant at all to be used in a production environment. I'm sure, if you went out looking, you'd find much better implementations of the algorithms I've written.
