Welcome to Mathematically
=========================

Mathematically is just a collection of mathematical algorithms I've implemented as I work through the exercises on [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org).

This library is not meant at all to be used in a production environment. I'm sure, if you went looking, you'd find much better implementations of the algorithms I've written. The algorithms have been implemented just how you'd perform them by hand.

To see what functions are available, and example usage of each, look in `spec/mathematically_spec.rb`
